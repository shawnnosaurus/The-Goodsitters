            <p>
              Animal lovers since the 1990's. Based in Cape Town, we bring years
              of experience caring for dogs, cats, birds, reptiles and homes
              across the Southern suburbs. Our founders Toni, Jenae and Megan
              still do sitting jobs themselves, while offering a selection of
              tailored and vetted recruiters as sitters across Cape Town.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every sitter is trained, contracted and introduced so you know
              exactly who's looking after your babies. Personal, reliable and
              genuinely caring.

                taking care of our hyper pup and chinchilla. I wouldn't trust my
                pet in the care of anyone else. Truly amazing and takes care of

                "Jenae looked after our dog for a week or so while we were in
                Durban. She was amazing with Pepper (our furbaby). Pepper was
                taken for walks regularly and Jenae kept us up to date with
                photos and we even video called her once. I would definitely use
                the goodsitters again. It was a relief to know Pepper was in
                good hands and safe while we were gone."
